x-slug: child-safety-seat-inspection-station-locator-nhtsa
description: The Child Safety Seat Inspection Station Locations are used to make it
  easier for all citizens to get their Child Safety Seats properly installed. Car
  crashes are the largest cause of fatalities and serious injuries for children between
  ages 2 and 15. Also, surveys indicate that a high percentage of Child Safety Seats
  are not installed properly. Information updates for each station are reported to
  NHTSA and enterred by NHTSA staff. NHTSA staff will also attempt to validate the
  station locations using a comercial Geographic database so this data will, in most
  cases, be able to be used for driving directions.
